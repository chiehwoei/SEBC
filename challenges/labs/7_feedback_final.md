Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?

I do feel that security topic is most helpful. Although Database availability is one of important scope for a production environment, i would like to suggest that do not involve Mysql replication in this boothcamp. So to focus more on other cloudera component such as Yarn resource management and administration including multi tenancy.
